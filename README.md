## 🚀 My LangChain Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step journey learning **LangChain** — from fundamentals to building production-ready, agentic AI applications. It’s designed as a **learning log + project showcase**, with clear milestones, examples, and lessons learned along the way.

> **Goal:** Become confident in building real-world LLM-powered systems using LangChain, FastAPI, and modern agentic patterns.

## 🧭 Where I Started

I began this journey with a strong foundation in:

* Python
* Machine Learning & Deep Learning
* FastAPI (APIs, CRUD, backend systems)
* Basic understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering

What I wanted next:

* How to **connect LLMs with tools, memory, and data**
* How to move from simple prompts → **AI agents**
* How to build **real-world AI applications**, not just demos

That’s where **LangChain** comes in.

## 🧱 Phase 1: LangChain Basics (Foundations)

### What I learned

* What LangChain is and **why it exists**
* Difference between:

  * Prompt-only LLM usage
  * Chain-based systems
* Core components:

  * `LLMs` / `ChatModels`
  * `PromptTemplate`
  * `Chains`

### Key Concepts

* Prompt templates vs hardcoded prompts
* Input / output flow in a chain
* Deterministic vs creative responses

---

## 🔗 Phase 2: Chains & Workflows

### What I learned

* `LLMChain`
* Sequential chains
* Simple pipelines (input → processing → output)

### Why this matters

Chains help structure logic so AI responses are:

* Reusable
* Testable
* Easier to debug

📁 **Folder:** `02_chains/`

## 🧠 Phase 3: Memory (Making AI Stateful)

### What I learned

* Why memory is important for chatbots
* Types of memory:

  * Conversation Buffer Memory
  * Summary Memory
  * Window Memory

### Real-world use cases

* Chatbots that remember users
* Context-aware assistants

📁 **Folder:** `03_memory/`

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Tools & Function Calling

### What I learned

* What **tools** are in LangChain
* How LLMs decide **when to use a tool**
* Creating custom tools (Python functions)

### Examples

* Calculator tool
* Database query tool
* API-calling tools

📁 **Folder:** `04_tools/`

---

## 🤖 Phase 5: Agents (Agentic AI)

### What I learned

* What an **agent** really is
* Difference between:

  * Chains
  * Agents
* How agents:

  * Reason
  * Choose tools
  * Act step-by-step

### Agent types explored

* ReAct agents
* Tool-using agents

📁 **Folder:** `05_agents/`

---

## 🗂️ Phase 6: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### What I learned

* Why LLMs need external knowledge
* Vector databases & embeddings
* Document loaders and text splitters

### Use cases

* Chat with PDFs
* Knowledge-base chatbots
* Internal company assistants

📁 **Folder:** `06_rag/`

---

## ⚙️ Phase 7: LangChain + FastAPI (Production)

### What I learned

* Wrapping LangChain logic inside APIs
* Request/response design for AI systems
* Error handling & logging

### Why this matters

This is where **projects become products**.

📁 **Folder:** `07_fastapi_integration/`

---

## 🧪 Phase 8: Projects (Hands-On)

### Projects built / planned

* 🤖 AI Chatbot with Memory
* ✈️ Flight Booking Assistant
* 🧮 Math Problem Solver Agent
* 📄 Document Question Answering System

📁 **Folder:** `08_projects/`

---

## 📚 What I’m Learning Along the Way

* Prompt engineering best practices
* Agent reliability & safety
* Evaluation of LLM outputs
* Cost & performance optimization

---

## 🛤️ What’s Next

* LangGraph (advanced agent workflows)
* Multi-agent systems
* Long-running AI services
* Deployment & scaling

---

## 🤝 Who This Repo Is For

* Beginners starting LangChain
* Developers moving into **Agentic AI**
* Anyone who wants **real-world AI projects**, not just theory
* Rag implementaion with modular language
