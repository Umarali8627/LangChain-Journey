On fields of green where hopes take flight,

The pitch lies still in morning light..

A bat held firm, a ball in hand,

Dreams stitched deep in the dusty sand.

The bowler runs with thundered pace,

Eyes fixed hard, no room for grace.
 
The ball swings late, a wicked seam,

Chasing cracks in a batter’s dream.

The batsman waits, calm and still,

Heart racing, mind of iron will.

One perfect shot, the crowd’s roar grows,

As leather sings and the boundary knows.

Wickets fall like moments lost,

Each one carrying a heavy cost.

Yet from collapse, a hero stands,

Writing fate with steady hands.

Days turn long, or nights ignite,

Under floodlights blazing bright.

From village lanes to grand displays,

Cricket binds us in countless ways.

It’s more than runs or winning sides,

It’s patience learned and swelling pride.

A game of silence, roar, and art—

Eleven souls, one beating heart. 🏏
